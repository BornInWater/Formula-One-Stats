# Formula-One-Stats

"*F1 is dictated by information technology nowadays*," said Franz Tost, team principal of Scuderia Toro Rosso Formula 1 team. 
"*Without computer data, there is no success in F1*."

Much of formula 1 revolves around data. Data from previous races, from previous years, every byte of it becomes vital in extracting
performance out of the car,tenths, hundreths, all of which dictate who is going to be standing at the topstep of the podium.

This project is an attempt to bring to fore statistics of the sport since its conception on 13th May, 1950 in Silverstone, the British Grand Prix.
